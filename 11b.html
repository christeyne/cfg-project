            <h2>eleven.</h2>
            <p>It’s been a week since you’ve been trapped inside the house, unable to move for fear of being caught by the Evil Queen. You’re not unused to captivity and general isolation by any means, but this time you can’t even take your mind off the loneliness by social networking because any suspicious activity might be detected. </br></br>
                You can’t stop thinking about your prince and regretting not staying in contact. He wouldn’t be able to find you now even if he wanted to, not now that you are hiding indoors and fearing for your life.</br></br>
                Today, you’re already done with the cleaning and meal preparation. It’s not difficult to keep the place clean when it seems to be all you can do. The dwarves are out at work and you don’t even have your little birds to talk to. </br></br>
                You hum to yourself, leaning your cheek onto your hand as you stare wistfully out of the window. Even if you have nothing else right now, you still have song, right? </br></br>
                Suddenly, a face pops up into the window from and you scream, leaping backwards in fright. </br></br>
                Recovering, but with your heart still beating frantically from the shock, you approach the window only to see a little girl standing there, looking quite lost and confused.</br></br>
                “Hello there,” you say kindly. “How are you doing today?"</br></br>
                “E-excuse me, miss,” she stammers shyly. “My father finally worked up enough money to get me one of these today but I’m afraid I have no idea how to make it work and I was wondering if you could help?</br></br>
                The little girl holds out a gadget you recognise as being the latest Apple iPhone.</br></br>
                Having dealt with Apple products in the past, you take the gadget from her and show her how to press the button to turn it on. </br></br>
                Suddenly, you feel faint and the world spins and darkens as you feel a strange twisting feeling as though you’re being sucked into a vacuum...</p>
