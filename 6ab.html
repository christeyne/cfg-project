            <h2>six.</h2>
            <p>You knock on the door and decide to be polite, tired as you are. </br></br>
                A group of dwarves answer the door and you blink down at them and smile. </br></br>
                “You’re at our home,” says one of them, as if you didn’t already know.  </br></br>
                You nod apologetically. “See, here’s the thing. My name is -“ </br></br>
                “Oh, we know who you are, Snow White,” another one says. “We live in the woods, sure, but we do have internet access, you know." </br></br>
                You explain the entire situation to them and they sigh and decide to take you in because they are fans of you on Mirror. And you can help them cook and clean.</br></br>
                You’re so polite and lovely that the leader of the dwarves steps up right before you’re about to go to bed. </br></br>
                "Hey, we have this spare phone. You said you had to get rid of your old one, right? Here, have this one; the Evil Queen shouldn’t be able to trace it to you. Just try not to post anything on Mirror, alright?" </br></br>
                You take the phone gratefully before drifting off to sleep. </br></br>
