                <h2>the end... or is it?</h2>
                <p>You don’t know how long it’s been.</br></br>
                    You feel weightless, drifting, ethereal even. You feel barely conscious, like you’re functioning but not awake. Any attempt to even try to fully process a thought ends in the thought escaping you, ephemeral.</br></br> 
                    You feel as though you’ve been trying to think for days, or months, or years, and you’re striving ever closer towards… sentience, maybe? </br></br>
                    The infinite space around you is dark but flashes of light and colour dart past you. Sometimes you can make out a word, or a picture. Sometimes you hear voices or laughter or the faint strains of music. You’re getting better at noticing things every day - or every… however time is measured here.</br></br>
                    You’ve been beginning to be able to see everything. You can interrupt the flowing light, push pictures around, take a phrase and place it elsewhere in the space. </br></br>
                    You think you know where you are. You’re beginning to realise what you can do now. And you think you’re getting more and more powerful with each passing moment. It all depends on you to take action now.</p>

                    The dwarves found you, collapsed and unbreathing in their home, unable to wake you and unable to revive you with true love's kiss.</br></br>
