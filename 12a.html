                <h2>happily ever after</h2>
                <p>Everything feels very strange. </br></br>
                    One minute, you’re being sucked into somewhere with a force that seems to squeeze the sentience out of you. You seem to remember a lifetime spent in that void, a cloud of almost-thoughts that suggest to you that perhaps you’d been there forever.</br></br>
                    The next, you’re expanding, growing ever larger until you suddenly find yourself blinking. Actually, physically blinking. It feels strange and unfamiliar, but your gaze automatically focuses and you look into the face of your prince. </br></br>
                    <i>Oh.</i> True Love’s Kiss.</br></br>
                    You sit up groggily, supported by your prince, and the dwarves crowd around you and hurriedly explain that they’d found you collapsed on the floor with a cursed Apple iPhone in your hand and luckily enough, they somehow had the idea to look through your phone and find your minimal, but still present, conversation with your prince. They called him over immediately and he revived you with True Love’s Kiss.</br></br>
                    And here you are now, laughing with your dwarf family and having the love of your life by your side. </br></br>
                    “And what of the Evil Queen?” You eventually ask when the relief dies down a little. You’re still worried for your life, and rightfully so.</br></br>
                    The prince declares that his kingdom is an ally of yours, that the war your father is fighting in is almost over. First, you will travel swiftly to his kingdom and together, you will take down the Evil Queen.</br></br>
                    The Evil Queen isn’t gone yet, but she is one step closer to being so. You’re safe for now, backed by a powerful force led by your One True Love, and once your little birds hear about the acts of treason committed towards you by the Evil Queen, winning this battle will be a piece of cake. </br></br>

            <p>Five months later, the prince is marrying a mysterious bride...</br></br>
                The Evil Queen is invited and she accepts the invitation to the wedding.</br></br>
                Alas for her, it is <i>your</i> wedding - the wedding of the princess she thought she had trapped forever! As punishment, she is sentenced to wear burning hot iron shoes and dnce until she drops dead.</br></br>
                The Evil Queen is finally gone. You are united with your prince and begin a new chapter of your life that can finally be lived happily ever after.</p>
