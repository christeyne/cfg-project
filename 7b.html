            <p>You’ve been living quite a peaceful life with your new dwarf friends, knowing you’re quite safe in hiding now that the Evil Queen thinks you’re dead. The dwarves have been tracking trends on Mirror to check up on the Queen. You cook and clean and sing for them and they’ve taught you how to go out to gather and scavenge for food. You’ve become somewhat of a family - it’s the first time you’ve properly had one and you can’t believe how lovely it is.</br></br>
                Despite having no phone and considering how much you relied on digital technologies before now, you’re doing surprisingly well without one. All your little birds are distraught at your sudden disappearance, thinking you’d been disposed of. You want to comfort them and let them know that you’re alright, but obviously that would be a ridiculous thing to do.</br></br>
                Throughout all of this, however, the romantic part of you can’t help but entertain fantasies of being swept up by a charming prince.</br></br>
                One day, you’re out picking fresh berries in the woods when you suddenly hear a rustling from behind you. </br></br>
                You immediately panic and turn around, only to be faced with… </br></br>
