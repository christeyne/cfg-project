            <p>This choose-your-own-adventure story follows the story of @snowwhite. Drawing on the classic fairytale of snowwhite and the seven dwarfs, in this story you are also deeply embedded in a digital culture of social media. With every choice you make, you are navigating a dangerous and magical world, helping @snowwhite to find her one true love. </br></br>
