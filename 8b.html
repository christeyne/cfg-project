            <p>…A tall, attractive man in somewhat military style clothing. He seems almost identical to the fictional romantic heroes of your dreams.</br></br>
                Call it instinct or call it insanity, you immediately know that he is the one for you. </br></br>
                You greet him shyly and he introduces himself as a prince from a foreign kingdom who is taking a break from his travels in these woods. </br></br>
                Somehow, the two of you end up talking for the whole day and you only realise this when the sun has almost completely set. By then, you have warmed up significantly to each other, but you know you need to be getting back home as the dwarves will be home from work soon. </br></br>
                “I must go,” you say, gathering your baskets of berries. </br></br>
                “Wait.” He stops you as you’re about to leave. “Don’t you have a phone or anything so we can keep in contact?" </br></br>
                You quickly explain your unfortunate lack of phone due to the whole Evil Queen and surveillance tracking situation. </br></br>
                He nods in understanding for a second before saying something that completely shocks you.</br></br>
                "Why don’t you come with me, then? I’ll keep you safe.”</br></br>
