/* so i think we just need to make sure that we give the class names enough specificity
so we know which classes are for the story pages vs index vs about
and we can separate them using comments like this as well just so we don't accidentally mix things up? 

for class names we could use
index: "main-" 
story pages: "page-"
about: "about-"

as prefixes for the class names for the different elements on each page just so we remember and can differentiate?
