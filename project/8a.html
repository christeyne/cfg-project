            <p>…A tall, attractive man in somewhat military style clothing. He seems almost identical to the fictional romantic heroes of your dreams.</br></br>
                Call it instinct or call it insanity, you immediately know that he is the one for you. </br></br>
                You greet him shyly and he introduces himself as a prince from a foreign kingdom who is taking a break from his travels in these woods. </br></br>
                Despite knowing that he is probably your One True Love, you run a number of surreptitious background checks on your phone about this prince and his credentials and trustworthiness. Luckily, everything seems to be genuine and the only slightly worrying press about the prince is that he once ran away from home for a while to be a pirate.</br></br>
                Somehow, the two of you end up talking for the whole day and you only realise this when the sun has almost completely set. By then, you have warmed up significantly to each other, but you know you need to be getting back home as the dwarves will be home from work soon.</br></br>
                “I must go,” you say, gathering your baskets of berries. </br></br>
                “Wait.” He stops you as you’re about to leave. “Don’t you have a phone or anything so we can keep in contact?" </br></br>
                You hesitate, wondering whether or not it would be dangerous to swap contact information with this guy. </br></br>
                "I mean, no pressure!” He quickly adds, looking adorably flustered. “I understand if it’s dangerous.”</br></br>

            <a href="9ab.html"class="button">B. You apologise and tell him that it would be too risky.</a>
