                <p>“Please don’t scream,” he says, wincing. “You don’t want to ruin that voice. You’ve got lots of fans, you know, who are still waiting to hear you sing.”</p>
                <p>“If you don’t let me go,” you say, feeling rather courageous, “I will cut my vocal chords, post a photo on Mirror and blame you for it. See if my fans don’t hunt you down after that, Huntsman.”</p>
                <p>He sighs, resigned. “Fine. But word of warning, you might want to be careful with that phone.”</p>
