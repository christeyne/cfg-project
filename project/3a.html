                <p>The Evil Queen, having seen your rising popularity on Mirror overtake hers through her tracked tags, becomes incensed and decides to try to kill you. One of your little birds alerts you of her plan to send her Huntsman after you. The Huntsman is a master tracker who once found the real life address of someone who offended the Evil Queen on the internet and sent an aggressive mob of haters after them. He is also a talented hitman. </p>
                <p>With this news, you escape from your tower when the Evil Queen is going through her daily tag-stalking and run through the forest, knowing that you are being hunted.   </p>
                <p>You’re beginning to tire, and the footsteps that you’re sure you heard behind you can’t be heard anymore. You lean over, hands on your knees, panting and trying to catch your breath, knowing that you’re totally lost… </p>
                <p>Suddenly, there’s a loud thump as someone jumps from the trees and lands in the foliage! You freeze as a cold blade is placed against your throat from behind!</p>
