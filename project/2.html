                <p>You live quite a confined life in reality, forcing you to direct your romanticism towards romance novels and otome games on your phone. </p>
                <p>On the internet, however, you’re a bit of a star. You’re a popular blogger on Mirror after posting a number of selfies and cute little vlog videos </p>

                <!-- IMAGE HERE -->


                <p>After mentioning on Mirror that singing is one of your interests, heaps of your little birds (your nickname for your followers) urge you to post a video of you singing.</p>
                <br>
                <p>CHOOSE:</p>
                <a href="3a.html"class="button">A. You decide to post a video of you singing to appease your followers.</a>
                <a href="3b.html"class="button">B. You ignore the wishes of your followers and keep your singing voice hidden from the public.</a>
