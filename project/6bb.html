            <p>You knock on the door and decide to be polite, tired as you are. </br></br>
                A group of dwarves answer the door and you blink down at them and smile. </br></br>
                “You’re at our home,” says one of them, as if you didn’t already know.  </br></br>
                You nod apologetically. “See, here’s the thing. My name is -“ </br></br>
                “Oh, we know who you are, Snow White,” another one says. “We live in the woods, sure, but we do have internet access, you know." </br></br>
                You explain the entire situation to them and they sigh and decide to take you in because they are fans of you on Mirror. And you can help them cook and clean.</br></br>
                Just as you’re going to pass out in bed from exhaustion, one of the dwarves yelps.</br></br>
                "Hey Snow, did you turn off your phone?! The Queen might be tracking you.”</br></br>
                Oh my goodness! You can’t believe you almost forgot to turn your phone off! You do so hurriedly and give it to the dwarves to completely reconfigure for you before falling asleep. </br></br>
