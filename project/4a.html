            <p>You struggle immediately, panicking. </br></br>
            Instead of slicing your throat out like you expected, however, your attacker drops the knife but keeps a firm hold of your shoulder and swivels you around. </br></br>
            “Snow White?” He asks. </br></br>
            You don’t respond, but he looks like he already knows who you are. </br></br>
            He sighs. “Look, princess, I’m sure word’s already got around, but I’m the Huntsman. The Queen hired me to kill you.”</br></br>
            You stare up at him defiantly. Tell you something you don't know, why doesn’t he?</br></br>
            As if in response to your thoughts, he looks down at you and sighs again, looking rather reluctant. “Right, here’s the thing. My daughter and I saw that video of you singing that you uploaded to Mirror the other day. We both loved it and I think it would be a huge shame if all that talent was wasted because of the Queen.”</br></br>
            Oh. That was unexpected. </br></br>
            He lets go of you to grab a photo of you from his pocket and a marker. “I’ll let you free on two conditions: remember me when you make it big; and sign this for my daughter and I.”</br></br>
            You’re ridiculously grateful for his offer (good thing you uploaded that singing video!) and you’d be stupid not to take it, so you sign the photo and turn to leave. </br></br>
            “Oh,” he adds and you pause to hear him out. “You might want to be careful with that phone of yours." </br></br>
            Choose: </br></br>

            <a href="5b.html"class="button">B. You keep your phone on you. You’ll be undetectable so long as you keep your 3G off, right?</a>
