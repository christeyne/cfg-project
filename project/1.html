<!--so i reckon we can number all of these by the same numbers/tags they have on the story files
    e.g. page 1 is 1.html, page 7b is 7b.html etc. so we know which ones to link them to-->

            <p>You are Snow White, a princess living in a fantasy world - but one that has a digital culture deeply embedded into it. Your hobbies include cleaning, cooking, singing, dreaming about your Prince Charming and social networking. You are very much a romantic at heart, wanting nothing more than to find true love with your Prince Charming. </br></br>
                Your father has recently left the kingdom to fight in a war, leaving your stepmother, the Evil Queen, in charge.</br></br>
                The Evil Queen is a vain, vain woman who is constantly concerned about her appearance. She frequently checks her vast social network, Mirror, to keep up with the ‘news’ of the kingdom. Her tracked tags on Mirror include<b>#fairestofthemall #theevilqueen</b> and <b>#snowwhite</b>. She tracks these tags and their trending curves maniacally. </p>
