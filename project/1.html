Your hobbies include cleaning, cooking, singing, dreaming about your Prince Charming and social networking. You are very much a romantic at heart, wanting nothing more than to find true love with your Prince Charming. </p>

She frequently checks her vast social network, Mirror, to keep up with the ‘news’ of the kingdom. Her tracked tags on Mirror include #fairestofthemall #theevilqueen and #snowwhite.
