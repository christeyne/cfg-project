                <h2>trust no man</h2>
                <p>You decide to trust the words alone of this man and follow him. </br></br>
                    As the two of you board a carriage to wherever, he tells you that the two of you can escape to a realm far away from here to keep you safe and you blush and fantasise about beautiful, peaceful landscapes and a lifetime spent with the prince of your dreams.</br></br>
                    With this in mind, the rhythmic movement of the carriage lulls you into a deep sleep.</br></br>
                    You are rudely awoken by being tossed unceremoniously onto a cold, stone floor in a dark cell that you suddenly, with a pang of dread, deduce to be the dungeons in your very own castle.</br></br>
                    You hear the laughter of the Evil Queen and your prince as she hands him a large sum of gold and thanks him for his service to the kingdom. It turns out that the prince knew who you were all along and decided to sell you to the Evil Queen for money and to improve foreign diplomatic relations in order prove himself to his father. </br></br>
                    You squeeze your eyes shut as the heeled footsteps of the Evil Queen approach you ominously.</p>
