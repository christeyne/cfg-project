            <h2>ten.</h2>
            <p>You return home, lighthearted and blushing, but your mood immediately sobers as the minute you open the door, the dwarves come rushing at you and shoving their phones in your face.</br></br>
                Your heart sinks.</br></br>
                Blaring from their screens are photos of you, taken while out gathering berries. The Original Poster doesn’t mean anything harmful by it; in fact the photos are accompanied by excited captions, thrilled to see you alive. They don’t realise that the Evil Queen has her beady gaze on every action made on mirror.</br></br>
                You know that the berry field is far away enough from the dwarves’ house that you’d probably have ample warning to escape before the Evil Queen comes to hunt you down, but the fact that she now knows that you’re alive puts a threat on the entire household.</br></br>
                Additionally, you have no idea where else to find your, and the dwarves’, favourite berries.</br></br>
                The dwarves kindly advise you to stay inside the house at all times. They’ve gotten their own food before your arrival and they can continue to provide for you; all that matters is your safety.  </p>
